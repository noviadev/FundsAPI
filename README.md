- A consumer should be able retrieve a single fund identified by its `MarketCode`.
- A consumer should be able retrieve all funds.
- A consumer should be able retrieve all funds from a given Fund Manager.


# The Activity

You have a limited amount of time to peer review the entire solution in regards to the User Story and best practice. Feel free to use GitHub or download the solution locally to explore the code base, and make notes separately. We will then go over your findings together afterwards.
